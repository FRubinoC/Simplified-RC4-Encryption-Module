# Simplified-RC4-Encryption-Module
This project consists on the implementation of a Simplified RC4 Encryption module written in System Verilog using the Modelsim and Quartus tools.

The organization of the file system is the following:
* db: HDL design files;
* tb: testbench;
* modelsim/tv: test vectors invoked within testbenches;
* quartus/constr: constraints files (.sdc);
* doc: project report.

The folders quartus and modelsim contain the scripts to automatically generate the Quartus project and the Modelsim project.

You can find all the details on the report_RC4_encryptor file in the doc folder.
